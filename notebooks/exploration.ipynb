          "And the overall vibes are great.",
          "the visual style is charming (I'm a massive sucker for silly little guys with big dumb smiles), the movement feels great, the challenges provided are fun, varied and just as charmingly silly as the characters themselves, and the badge and customization systems offer a great system of progression that feels great to play with.",

          "Do you like exploring?",
          "The loop of completing individual islands is great, they're the perfect size and don't require a large time commitment, and the loop of completing the whole game is also well-paced, feeling substantial enough for some who only wants to play through once, but also reasonable for starting over again and again in new game+, if you're into that kind of thing.",
          "It did start to become stale before the very end, like \"We made 20 unique items but they all just shoot you upwards.\"",
          "Just a seriously well-done game, simple core mechanic with nice variations as you progress.",
